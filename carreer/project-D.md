# The Story
Despite commitmens to agile methodology we found ourselves in early 2017 without much to show for our efforts. No customers and nothing viable to put customers on.  We resolved to make 2017 the year where we changed that. The first half of that year was a focused effort to build everything needed to bring a customer onboard in the second half of that same year. Messaging about the expectations was given and received to Director and SVP levels. Commitmentss were accepted. Our Program Manager accepted the customer commitment in the second half of Q3. He failed. No significant response from SVP and Director levels was seen from that failure. I became deeply concerned that a project that had nothing to show for it's existence in over a year and a half wasn't getting any attention from upper management when it failed.  Q4 starts with a second phase of design and implementation. That second phase was being proposed by another engineer on the team and presented to the Program Manager, Director, SVP and Founder. There was widely accepted agreement that the second phase was a large effort that was going to require multiple years. The prospect of entering another multi-year phase of the project without any customer success was hard for me fathom and thus began my deep questioning about the decision making above me. Q4 finished without any further development on customer adoption. Plans for Q1 had been agreed upon with another commitment by Program Mangament to bring in customers. Most of the focus was going to be on the second phase.  I had frankly given up at this point but wanted get past the holiday before I made any significant decisions or changes.  In the first week of Q1 I resolved to give it one more go and see what I could do to change course. I approached the Director and SVP and spoke honestly about my conerns. There was a month of contentious meetings to change the Q1 course, and the result was that I would be the point person on bringing a customer onto the greenfield product. After two months of dedicated effort doing only that task I succeeded. Q1 ended with the first fulltime production customer. In the planning process for Q2 I made it clear that Q2 needed to be about proving that there was a pipeline of compentency for onboarding customers that didn't require my personal attention for every aspect. I was involved in bi-weekly status meetings where I continualy voiced my concern that no substantial progress beyond superficial stage account work had been done. My concerns were heard but nothing changed. Q2 came to an end and the same Program Manager who had accepted the commitmant in Q3 and Q4 was unable again to yield a result in Q2.
